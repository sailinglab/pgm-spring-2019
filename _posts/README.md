Lecture Notes Scribe Guidelines
-------------------------------

Scribing lectures is one of the course [requirements](https://sailinglab.github.io/pgm-spring-2019/description/#grading) for 10708 PGM class.
In spring 2019, students taking the class are asked to write up their notes in the form of blog posts using the [Distill.pub](https://distill.pub/) format (v2).
We provide a template ([source](https://github.com/sailinglab/pgm-spring-2019/blob/master/_posts/2019-01-09-lecture-notes-template.md), [rendered](https://sailinglab.github.io/pgm-spring-2019/notes/lecture-notes-template/)) for the notes that showcases the main blocks that students may use when writing up their notes (e.g., equations, different formats of images, etc.).

## Preparation

To prepare the scribe notes, you'll need a few steps.

### Preliminary steps
- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the course repository.
- Create a new branch named `notes-lecture-xx` where `xx` stands for the lecture number.
- In the settings of your fork, select GitHub Pages source to `notes-lecture-xx` branch.
- Make sure GitHub Pages correctly renders the webpage at `<your-github-username>.github.io/pgm-spring-2019`.

### Write up lecture notes
- Using the template, write up and add your notes to `_posts/yyyy-mm-dd-lecture-xx.md` and bibliography to `assets/bibliography/yyyy-mm-dd-lecture-xx.bib` (in the BibTeX format; here is [an example](https://github.com/sailinglab/pgm-spring-2019/blob/master/assets/bibliography/2019-01-09-lecture-notes-template.bib)).
- Make sure the title of the notes is formatted as `Lecture xx: <lecture title>`.
- Make sure the lecture and the authors information is correct.

## Submission

To submit your lecture notes for review, create [a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) (PR) into the master branch of the course repository.
You will be assigned one of the TAs as an editor who will review your notes and approve or request changes.
Once the editor is satisfied with the quality of the scribed notes, your PR will be merged.
Once the PR is merged, authors of the submitted notes get credit for scribing.
